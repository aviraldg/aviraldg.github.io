I am currently available for all kinds of consulting projects with a special focus on the following languages, platforms and frameworks:

- Android
- Python (Django, Flask, etc.)
- JavaScript (AngularJS, React, etc.)
- Node.js

If this interests you, please send an email (subject prefix: **Work**) to `me@<this domain>.com` with functional specifications, references and a background on what has already been implemented (if applicable.) If you aren't at this stage yet, I can help you convert your idea into wireframes and feature specifications.

Please note that I **do not work for equity**. I work on either a fixed hourly rate or a fixed total rate based on a full-project estimate.

If you have a technical background and need specific help and advice, you can contact me through CodeMentor:
