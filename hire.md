I am currently available for all kinds of consulting projects with a special focus on the following languages, platforms and frameworks:

- Android
- Python (Django, Flask, etc.)
- JavaScript (AngularJS, React, etc.)
- Node.js

If this interests you, please send an email (subject prefix: **Work**) to `me@<this domain>.com` with functional specifications, references and a background on what has already been implemented (if applicable.) If you aren't at this stage yet, I can help you convert your idea into wireframes and feature specifications.

Please note that I **do not work for equity**. I work on either a fixed hourly rate or a fixed total rate based on a full-project estimate.

If you have a technical background and need specific help and advice, you can contact me through CodeMentor: <a href="https://www.codementor.io/aviraldg?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=aviraldg&utm_campaign=github"><img src="https://cdn.codementor.io/badges/contact_me_github.svg" alt="Contact me on Codementor" style="max-width:100%" /></a>
