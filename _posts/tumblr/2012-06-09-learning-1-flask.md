This is a new series of posts wherein I’ll post about something at the start of a month, learn about it and experiment with it through the month. At the end of the month, I’ll make a post about all my experiments and learnings.



To kick things off, this month, I’ll be doing: Flask, the Python microframework.

Why Flask?

I’ve been using Django for Python web development for years now, and it works rather well. Recently, I saw Kenneth Reitz’s presentation, “Flasky Goodness: Or Why Django Sucks.” While I won’t go all the way and say that Django sucks outright, he definitely makes some valid points. I’ve also heard (mainly good things) about Flask before. Hence, Flask. Also, I’ve used Jinja before and need experience with SQLAlchemy for another (CLI) app I’m building.

In addition to all the points mentioned above, this will also help me test my theory that microframeworks require you to reinvent the wheel, several times over (compared to frameworks like Django.)
