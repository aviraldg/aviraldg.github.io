I just changed my default search engine to DuckDuckGo, and I must say, it’s really amazing. The stylish, but minimalist homepage looks like Google, minus the additional clutter. Searches are completely anonymous and pool in results from a variety of sources, ranging from Amazon to Wikipedia. Ads are unobstrusive and can even be completely disabled if you want. The best feature, though, is what I’ll call bang queries.

If you’re a developer like me, most of your searches are for API documentation and the like. With DuckDuckGo, you can add a bang(!) to the starting of your query with the name of the site for targeted search. Still don’t get me? Try these:

!django QuerySet
!python collections.OrderedDict
This isn’t just limited to Python and Django; DuckDuckGo has bang query support for a surprisingly large number of sites. Another really awesome thing is that some queries feel intelligent. For example, try searching for xkcd.

If you’re a developer, or are tired of your regular search engine “customising” your search results to death, you should definitely try out DuckDuckGo!

ps. “I’m Feeling Ducky” is the DuckDuckGo equivalent of “I’m Feeling Lucky”
