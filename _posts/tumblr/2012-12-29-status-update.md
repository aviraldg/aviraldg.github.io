I haven’t posted here in a while, so here’s a status update: I’m alive. :)

11th grade doesn’t really leave you with much time for anything. So… anyway, no excuses :)

I had my second term exams - and I screwed up pretty bad.
Shubham and I came 2nd at the TCS IT WIZ national finals held in Chennai. Prempal and Arnav from Delhi won (on the tie breaker!) – hats off!
I started volunteering with Sahana Eden. More about this later.
