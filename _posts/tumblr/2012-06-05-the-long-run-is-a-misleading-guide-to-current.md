title: The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are
  all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous
  seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again.

The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again. — John Maynard Keynes—(I found this particularly interesting, especially in context — it was posted by a commenter on a HN thread about Groupon and what its fate might have been had it been bought by Google.)
