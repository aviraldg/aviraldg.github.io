I feel terrible saying this, but online advertising is dead. It never was “alive” anyway — and the reason is simple: if I needed to do something, I wouldn’t be online (definitely not on Facebook). If I needed to buy something online, I’d already be on Flipkart (or Amazon for those of you who aren’t familiar with the Indian ecommerce giant.) If I needed your service I’d already have found it on Google.

Not through an ad.
