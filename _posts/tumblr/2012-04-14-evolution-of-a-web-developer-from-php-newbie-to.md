Evolution of a Web Developer From PHP Newbie To Python Ninja(See link above) This almost completely describes my history in web development, apart from the fact that unlike the author, I quickly realised that I was happier with Postgres (and other traditional relational databases) after a run-in with Google’s AppEngine Datastore (a non-relational database like MongoDB.) Also, I couldn’t tolerate PHP long enough to even try out CakePHP and other such monstrosities.*

*I’m not sure which, but a friend recently pointed out to me that at least one of these PHP frameworks generates code from your database schema. Like… database schema goes in, and generated code comes out. That can’t be good.
