Quick, without much thought, how would you extract the sign of a 32-bit integer?
The question isn’t difficult but is interesting as it gives you an insight into a person’s though process. Most low-level C hackers who don’t know better (like yours truly from about three or four years ago.) will start rambling about sign bits and two’s complement and whatnot. Funny, right?

I think this should replace (complement?) FizzBuzz tests, period.
