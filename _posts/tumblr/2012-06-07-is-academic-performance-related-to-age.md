(This data was gathered from my school’s examination results.)

Apparently not. It looks like academic performance has no correlation with age. However there’s a noticeable dip in the graph towards the “19+” end, which might be caused by these students failing and repeating the class (hence the age difference.)

(The dataset consisted of 230 tenth-graders.)
