TCS IT Wiz is coming up (the Kolkata editionâ€™s on the 9th) and that means a lot of research work, especially from Wikipedia. So, I wrote up a quick tool to export Wikipedia pages as PDFs. First, install Python 2.7 from here and download the following script:

Then, install PIP by downloading and running https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py and execute the following commands:

<<<<<<< be8604e3799caa8ddd28e8cd6783a7eb83d047ad
	aviraldg@aviraldg-netbook:~$ pip install beautifulsoup4
	aviraldg@aviraldg-netbook:~$ pip install requests
=======
aviraldg@aviraldg-netbook:~$ pip install beautifulsoup4
aviraldg@aviraldg-netbook:~$ pip install requests

>>>>>>> Tumblr merge.

Now, just create a text file which lists all the topics you want to download, each on a new line, and drag this file on top of the wikipdf script (or execute it from the terminal with the list file as an argument.)

Comment if you have problems or want to offer feedback.
