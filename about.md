Hi, I'm **Aviral**. I was born and brought up in **[Jamshedpur, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamshedpur)** but currently live in **[Dublin, Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin)**, where I work as an **SWE/SRE at Google**. 
I've previously worked at **Amazon** and **Bloomberg**, before which I studied **Computer Science and Engineering** at **[KIIT University, Bhubaneswar](http://kiit.ac.in/)** (2018) and **[Loyola School, Jamshedpur](https://loyolajsr.com/)** (2014.)
