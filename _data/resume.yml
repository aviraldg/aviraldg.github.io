      I am responsible for the data extraction, storage and ML experimentation,
      training & serving platforms that support ML teams across Google, both as
      a first responder for production incidents, and as a developer with a
      reliability/scalability focus.

      - Designed and implemented automation to reallocate ML hardware
        accelerators (TPUs) when blocked on feature extraction (saving between
        27~36 SWE/yr)  
      - Designed and implemented infrastructure to allow ML models to block on
        input data completeness (protecting against failure modes that have cost
        $xM in the past)
      - Completed and productionized service that batches
        together configuration changes to avoid overloading storage backend
        (unblocked processes essential for revenue critial model
        experimentation.)
      - Conducted production readiness review for new transfer learning system.

        Wrote missing integration tests to make these services' pipelines' full 
        CD.
      - Automated a lengthy and error-prone manual onboarding process, freeing up
        1 SDE/yr.
      - Analysed legacy codebase to find and fix system-wide issues involving
